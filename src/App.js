// Base
// Complete High Card with the following features.
// Determine who has won each round (Player 1 or Player 2) - Done
// Keep score during each game (how many rounds has each player won) - Done
// Declare a winner at the end of each game when the deck has run out of cards, and give the players the option to restart the game.
// Comfortable
// Add nice-to-have features.
// Style the app to clarify what each UI component is for. Clarify which card belongs to which player. Consider using React Bootstrap or MUI components as default styles.
// Create a re-usable PlayingCard component to render cards nicely. This component can use playing card images or create a custom playing card UI.
// More Comfortable
// If you have time and want to practise more.
// Allow players to keep track of scores across games, not just across rounds within a single game.
